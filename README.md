# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage that contains UFO sightings information. We will extract and create a table of the data, but the most important part is the ability to filter through multiple criteria to gain an in depth analysis of UFO sightings. 

- Resources:
  - HTML, CSS
  - Javascript
  - Bootstrap

## Results: 
The table contains information by Date, City, State, Country, Shape (of sighting), Duration, and Comments on the sighting. The filter allows to search through every category except Duration and Comments.  

## Summary: 
A major drawback of this filter is entering the data in the search bar; it must be exactly the same as it is entered in the data file. If someone captializes something that wasn't capitalized, it won't show up. If you were to misspell a word or enter the data incorrectly, it won't return any results. 
Additionally, I suggest allowing filtering for multiple criteria at once. Creating a multiple selection tool to search both circle and sphere shapes at once, for example. As well as adding a filtering criteria for duration, staggered so that you can search in chunks of time.
